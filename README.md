# Sales Project - Preview and predictions

## This was a project made to analyze the data in order to determine steps that can be made in increase the product sales of items in store.

### Business Problem:
We have recorded data of item sales for each business location and would like to analyze the data to see where they can improve certain store criterias to increase the sales of items. also included is a prediction mothod so we can test the items data to roughly predict what the sale of the item will be for that location with the changing criterias. 

### Data:
When looking at the data the items seem be be sold in more volume at the Super Market Type Three locations and I also noticed that the visibility of the item seemed to have a coorelation with the items sales.

### Recommendations:
Based of some of the data I looked at it seems that Items that have good visibility seem to be sold in higher volume, so prioritizing the visual needs of items may boost sales for the items. Also, i would look into how the Outlet types are different and why one sells more items in total compared to the others. 

### Next Steps:
I fell that next steps would be to get more data on the stores themselves to see how each of them differ from eachother. maybe some of the options like visibilty is due to one location having more floor space then the others, or what the difference is in physical location of the sites. also maybe getting some data points on how many customers come into each store and test that against number of items sold, to see what the percentage of people coming into the store and buying items is.
